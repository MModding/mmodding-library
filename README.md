## Overview

The MModding Library is a set of tools made by the MModding organization providing new useful systems in mod making.

Players should not expect any relatable content coming directly from the library. The magecraft only occurs with the mods using this library.

## Development Usages

The MModding organization provides a detailed documentation of the modules in the form of a [Wiki](https://docs.mmodding.com).
